# Hugo Paginator

This is WIP.

Currently all the layouts and configs can be found on
[simonwoodtli.com][website]. I plan to migrate them here in the future and
further abstract the files to make them easier usable.

## Features

The Hugo theme Paginator is great if you want to publish some blog posts and
have two separate blog types that aggregate together on the home page. You can
use link posts to react and give your take on links. Or use post posts for your
own articles.

* Tailwind CSS
